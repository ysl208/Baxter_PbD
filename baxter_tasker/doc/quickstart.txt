Quickstart
==========

Run the baxter shell script to source the packages and setup the ROS environment. ::

	$ cd ~/ros_ws/
	$ ./baxter.sh

From now on you need at least 2 terminals.
If you have installed the 3d environment, called MoveIt, then we have to start
this environment first. The next command starts MoveIt, RViz and the trajectory
action server for the robot. The action server handles all trajectory requests
to execute	a move, evading all obstacles in your 3D scene. ::

	$ roslaunch baxter_tasker moveit_baxter.launch
		
Sometimes RViz crashes. In this case press Ctrl+C and start the launchfile again. 
		
In case you have limited resources you could instead start everything without RViz by: ::

	$ roslaunch baxter_tasker moveit_baxter_norviz.launch

For testing moveit, it is recommened to run the monitor now, which can be used for fast 
evaluation of arm trajectories. If you see values for both arms then your moveit is working. 
You can start the monitor by: ::

	$ roslaunch baxter_tasker monitor.launch

If everything went fine so far, can start the baxter_tasker software. This starts you
the GUI on the computer and on baxter and enables the easy access to all sensors. Start
it by typing the following in another terminal: ::

	$ roslaunch baxter_tasker baxter_tasker_main.launch
