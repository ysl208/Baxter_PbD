The Interface on the Workstation
--------------------------------

The interface on the computer consists of two columns of buttons on the left side, a list of tasks in the middle and an editor on the right. The buttons offer some functionality to trigger specific functions, which are described in detail below. 
Not all of them are available on the robot. In fact you are working with a collaborative robot. 
The idea behind is that you can create a new task, learn with the robot, which generates Python code in the editor field.
In this interface you have the possibility to modify parameters of this code and also access nearly the complete interface in the background.
You can simply save your task by clicking on File (in the top row) and click on "Save all Tasks". Once you generated or wrote some code, you select your task from the list and click on the execute button. This gives you the power to test stuff very quickly.
